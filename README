Dependencies
------------

python-oauth2   https://github.com/simplegeo/python-oauth2
httplib2        http://code.google.com/p/httplib2

Additional for non-GAE deployment:
    Django 1.1+

    if serving with Apache:
        Apache 2.2
        mod-wsgi 


Installation (non-GAE)
----------------------

1.  Create a django project called 'django_snippets' and copy
    everything from the tarball into it, overwriting settings.py,
    etc...

2.  Uncomment the database lines in settings.py

3.  Create a db/ directory inside the project

4.  Sync the database and give it to Apache (if you want to serve
    it properly).

    $ python manage.py syncdb
    # chown -R yourself:www-data db/
    # chmod -R g+w db/


Yahoo consumer details
----------------------

When you set up a boss-enabled application at developer.yahoo.com,
you get a consumer key and consumer secret. The app uses these to
sign the oauth payload.

Create a config.py file inside the project, with a single
dictionary in it, as follows:

yboss = {
    'key':'YOUR_CUSTOMER_KEY',
    'secret':'YOUR_CUSTOMER_SECRET'
}

At this point, you should be able to run the app using django's
development server.

# python manage.py runserver

If you want to extend the app at some point to do anything remotely
interesting with non-oauth sessions, which it doesn't at the moment,
change the SECRET_KEY in snippets/settings.py to something
appropriate and keep it secret.


VirtualHost (Apache)
--------------------

Notes:

1. Alias /static/ ... will ensure Apache serves static content
   directly, rather than sucking it through django. This directive
   must occur prior to the WSGIScriptAlias.

2. Because django.wsgi resides in a folder containing other code,
   for security reasons you must make it available explicitly,
   rather than by unlocking its parent directory.

<VirtualHost *:80>

    ServerName yourservername.com
    ServerAlias www.yourservername.com

    Alias /static/ /usr/local/django/snippets/static/
    <Directory /usr/local/django/snippets/static/>
        AllowOverride None
        Options all 
        Order deny,allow
        Allow from all 
    </Directory>

    WSGIScriptAlias / /usr/local/django/snippets/django.wsgi
    <Files /usr/local/django/snippets/django.wsgi>
        Order deny,allow
        Allow from all 
    </Files>

</VirtualHost>

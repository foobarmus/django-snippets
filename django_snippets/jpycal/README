Jpycal 1.0 (django/GAE)
Author: Mark Donald <mark@skagos.com.au>

Abstract
========
Jpycal is a pluggable django app that
implements a RESTful event management API.
It contains a web interface based on Adam
Shaw's FullCalendar JQuery plugin, with
basic event creation and editing functions
added.

Out of the box, it is configured for GAE
deployment, so events are stored in GAE's
datastore.

Jpycal is released under a BSD license
which is included with this package.

FullCalendar is dual-licensed under MIT

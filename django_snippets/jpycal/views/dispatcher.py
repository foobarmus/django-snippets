"""
Request dispatcher for jpycal.
Author: Mark Donald <mark@skagos.com.au>

Exposes our RESTful url scheme to Django's built-in
url dispatcher. For clarity, this probably should
be called 'subdispatcher' but I prefer the shorter
version.

        Treat PUT/DELETE request data as form-urlencoded.

        Django doesn't do this by itself because PUT/DELETE
        requests are not usually made by browsers and therefore
        the payload probably isn't in that format.

        We are handling PUT requests only because this is an
        example app, and the RESTful API should be able to
        accept direct PUT requests from other apps (in which
        case the payload should be type-checked and parsed
        appropriately - which we are not doing, for the sake of
        brevity).

        Fullcalendar is configured to issue PUTs as overloaded
        POST requests, in accordance with the HTML5 spec, so
        never calls this function.
